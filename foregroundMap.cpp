/**@brief Class describes the top layer of the game map
@author Carolyn Owen
details The class contains the units on a 2D vector and manages event handling when the map area is clicked on. 
	The vector containing the units uses pointers to unit objects which are owned by players of the game. 
	All events/clicks on the main map are handled by the foreground map event handler which allows units to move, 
	attack, die, display their information or initiate and manage special abilities.

/**@brief Constructor for a foreground map object
details This function takes the size parameters of the desired map, pointers to image handler and text display box to use, 
	the players of the game and a vector pointing to the control points on the map.
	When it is called, the constructor stores the given values and then populates the 2d vector representing the map with 
	either null pointers or unit pointers. The units for each player are created here and added to either player. Player 1's units 
	are populated to the top row of the map and player 2's units are populated to the bottom row of the map. Then, it sets the last 
	clicked unit pointer to null to represent that no unit on the board has been clicked on yet. 

@param  integer value of the tile width in pixels
@param	integer value of the tile height in pixels
@param 	integer value of the number of rows in the map
@param 	integer value of the number of columns in the map

@param	pointer to the text display box to use to display unit stats and notifications to the player
@param 	pointer to player 1
@param	pointer to player 2
@param 	pointer to a vector of control point pointers to use in calculating score

	combination scenarios to determine which action to take. See below for scenarios:

	clicked index is empty (no unit on the square) and a unit of this player's was clicked previously 
		-> see if the unit can move to that location (in range?)
		-> if in range, the unit has enough movement left for this turn and the unit isn't trying to move on top of a control point, 
		   move the unit to the new index in the vector and reset the unit's internal position information

	an empty tile was clicked with nothing being clicked before
		-> do nothing

	a unit was right clicked 
		-> check if the unit is owned by the current player
		-> if it is, try to activate the unit's special ability with the unit's triggering function

	the square contains a unit and it is a double click
		-> display the info about the unit in the foreground map's text display box

	clicked index has a unit of the other player's and a unit owned by the current player was clicked previously
		-> check that the other player's unit is within attack range of the player's unit
		-> check that the attacking unit has attacks left for this turn
		-> attack the other unit
		-> check for dead units and remove them from the player object as well as the foreground map if so
		-> clear the pointer to the last clicked unit for the player's next move

	unit clicked is the current player's 
		-> if the unit has already been used up for this turn, let the player know and don't store info about this unit 
		-> otherwise add it to the unit clicked pointer for next time
