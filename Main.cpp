/**@brief Main controls creation and management of game object
@author Carolyn Owen
details This class defines the size of the game window and creates a new game object. While the game is running, 
	main renders the game to the window, gets an event indicating interaction with the game window, 
	checks to make sure that it isn't an end event and passes it to the game to handle. If the game ends or the 
	player triggers an end event in the window, main gracefully exits from the program, deleting all objects as required (in all levels)
